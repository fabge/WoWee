// Every setting this client has, except the five bound to a Blizzard control.
//
// Those five - mouse speed, the minimap clock, friendly nameplates, ground
// clutter and the sound effects volume - are driven from FrameXML's own Video,
// Sound and Interface panels through kClientCVars, and listing them here as
// well would draw a second control for the same value. The root panel names
// them and says where they are.
//
// View distance was a sixth until 2026-08-13, and should not have been: the
// Video panel that was supposed to drive it is suppressed along with the rest
// of FrameXML's game menu, so nothing the player can open offered it. Before
// leaving a setting out of here on the grounds that a Blizzard control has it,
// check that the frame holding that control is not in kSuppress.
//
// The order is the order they are read in: a category is a panel, a section is
// a heading on it, and a setting whose section is "" continues the one above.
// Ranges match the settings window's own sliders, because they are the ranges
// the client clamps to; a control that offers more than the client accepts is a
// control that appears to do nothing at the ends.
